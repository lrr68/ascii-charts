Plot charts on the terminal with ascii text.

## About:
This is a work in progress, currently it is only possible to
plot charts by hard coding them before the execution loop.
The goal with this project is to have a program that can plot
charts interactivelly, via the command line or reading a csv file.
This is not meant to be a super complete program, as ascii and terminals
have their limitations. The ideia is to have a fast and simple way to view
data on the terminal.

Bellow is a list of goals of this application.

## Goals:
+ [x] Be able to plot bar, line and pie charts
+ [x] Plot chart non interactivelly to the terminal and exit
+ [ ] Be able to create charts with command line arguments
+ [ ] Be able to create new charts interactivelly
+ [ ] Create charts from CSV
+ [ ] Multiple panels to handle multiple chart views
+ [ ] Basic reports based on charts (total, average, minimum, maximum)

## TODO:
This is a list of the features being developed currently.

+ Add command line color command
+ parse command line args to create more than one chart
+ make create charts interactive command
+ print error message in a pretty way
